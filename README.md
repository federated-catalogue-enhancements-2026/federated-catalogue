# Federated Catalogue

## Description
The Federated Catalogue Service makes Self-Descriptions of Providers, their Service Offerings and Resources used by these services available to Consumers.

This project was initiated as a Reference Implementation of Gaia-X Federation Services Lot 5 [Federated Catalogue / Core Catalogue Features](https://www.gxfs.eu/core-catalogue-features/).

## Documentation
All service documentation, installation instructions and other materials can be found in [our wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/federated-catalogue/wiki).

## Support
To get support you can open an issue in the project [Issues](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/federated-catalogue/issues) section.

## Getting Started
To start with FC project please follow the instructions: [Steps to build FC](./docker/README.md).

## Trust Framework Configuration

The Federated Catalogue can be operated with or without Gaia-X Trust Framework validation. By default, Gaia-X compliance validation is **disabled**, allowing the catalogue to be used in other ecosystems and use cases.

### Configuration Options

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `federated-catalogue.verification.trust-framework.gaiax.enabled` | `false` | Enable/disable Gaia-X Trust Framework validation |
| `federated-catalogue.verification.trust-framework.gaiax.trust-anchor-url` | (Gaia-X registry URL) | URL for Gaia-X Trust Anchor Registry (only used when enabled) |

### Behavior

**When `gaiax.enabled: false` (default):**
- Credentials can be uploaded without Gaia-X compliance validation
- No calls are made to the Gaia-X Digital Clearing House or Trust Anchor Registry
- Signature verification still works but does not require Gaia-X trust anchors
- Any valid Verifiable Credential/Presentation can be stored

**When `gaiax.enabled: true`:**
- Full Gaia-X Trust Framework validation is enforced
- Credentials must have valid trust anchor chains registered with Gaia-X
- Calls are made to the Gaia-X Trust Anchor Registry for validation

### Example Configuration (application.yml)

```yaml
federated-catalogue:
  verification:
    trust-framework:
      gaiax:
        enabled: false  # Set to true for Gaia-X compliance
        trust-anchor-url: "https://registry.lab.gaia-x.eu/v1/api/trustAnchor/chain/file"
```

## Roadmap
The project v1.0.0 was released in February 2023.
